Core Functionalities:

Event Registration and Ticketing: The platform should empower users to create events, define various ticket types and their prices, oversee registrations, and handle payments efficiently. It's crucial to explore integration possibilities with local payment gateways to enhance accessibility.

Event Website Builder: Our aim is to facilitate the creation of custom-branded event websites using intuitive drag-and-drop tools. These websites should feature comprehensive agendas, speaker biographies, and seamless registration forms. It's essential to ensure adaptability to Arabic language and design preferences to cater to a broader audience effectively.

Attendee Experience Enhancement: The platform should offer attendees easy access to schedules, venue maps, speaker details, networking opportunities, and real-time event updates. Furthermore, providing offline functionality and accommodating local language preferences and data usage limitations are paramount for ensuring inclusivity and accessibility.

Event Management Tools: We need to incorporate robust event management features such as check-in management, badge printing, lead capture, analytics, and comprehensive reporting capabilities. Additionally, it's imperative to prioritize data security and privacy compliance to align with local regulations and ensure user trust and confidence.

By focusing on these core functionalities, we aim to create a versatile and user-centric platform that fulfills the diverse needs of event organizers and attendees alike. Looking forward to your feedback and insights to refine our approach further.
